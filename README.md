Game description
==
A slime wishes to climb a mountain. Unfortunately, the knapsack he brought along does not have the largest capacity..

As he scales the mountain, enemy slimes are encountered along the way, blocking his path. Thankfully, there are also safe zones scattered along the mountain that seem to have weapons stored by past mountain climbers! However, with your limited knapsack space, what weapons will you choose to bring along, and how do you pack them optimally?

This game spans across 60 levels, and offers 3 different difficulties, with knapsacks that require increasing amounts of strategy.

Can you scale the mountain quick enough, or will you freeze before reaching the top?

Background
==
hello, this is my first game i've tried creating in Godot, learning to master some Godot features + practise some pixel art
while not the most polished, i do really like the game idea and just wanted to throw it out there :)

this game was initially made for a game jam hosted in my school with the theme "knapsack", which unfortunately ended a little abruptly, but it was what gave me the inspiration for this game idea anyway :)
